# identify-question-type-using-keras-and-machine-learning
This is a machine learning project to identify the type of question being asked like affirmative(yes/no),what,when and unknown.
I have used tensorflow ,keras,glove,lstm for this.
This gives maximum accuracy than other classification methods.
